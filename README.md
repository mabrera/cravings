# Cravings

Cravings is a restaurant catalog and review site. It includes a search feature with the ability to filter results by setting, cuisine and price range; a review and ratings system; and the ability to create and edit your own dinelists (think music playlists, except instead of music it's restaurants; I know, I'm super clever at naming things). Feel free to create a profile to access all these cool features and more!

You can see the site live at http://54.212.3.232/category/setting
